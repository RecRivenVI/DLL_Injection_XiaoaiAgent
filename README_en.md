# DLL_Injection_XiaoaiAgent

## Project Overview

`DLL_Injection_XiaoaiAgent` is an example native Windows (C++) project intended for research/demonstration purposes. It demonstrates techniques related to processes and DLLs. The repository contains a CMake-based example program and resource files.

Important: The techniques in this repository have dual-use potential (they can be used for legitimate research or abused). Run and test this project only when you have permission or within a controlled environment (virtual machine, isolated testbed). Comply with laws and the target system's usage policies.

## Contents

- `CMakeLists.txt` — CMake build script
- `DLL_Injection_XiaoaiAgent.cpp` — main source file (review for implementation details)
- `resource.rc` — resource script

## Dependencies

- Windows (development and runtime environment)
- CMake (recommended 3.15+)
- Visual Studio (MSVC toolchain) or another Windows-capable compiler
- Windows SDK

## Build (on Windows / PowerShell)

Recommended: Visual Studio generator

```powershell
# Run in repository root (pwsh / PowerShell)
mkdir build
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"
cmake --build build --config Release
```

If you prefer NMake:

```powershell
mkdir build
cmake -S . -B build -G "NMake Makefiles"
cmake --build build --config Release
```

After building, the executable is typically under `build/Release` (depending on generator and configuration).

## Run & Test

- For demonstration/research only. Do not run on systems you do not own or have authorization to test. Use isolated VMs or controlled test environments.
- Inspect `DLL_Injection_XiaoaiAgent.cpp` to understand the implementation, and do not use the program for unauthorized intrusion, disruption, or circumventing security controls.

## Security & Legal Disclaimer

This project is provided for learning, testing, defensive research, or educational purposes only. The authors/maintainers are not responsible for any legal liability or damage arising from misuse. Confirm that you have permission to test target systems. Obtain written authorization for security testing and act within the agreed rules of engagement.

## Suggested Next Steps

- Add a `LICENSE` file to clarify licensing (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0). (Added in this repo: MIT)
- Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` to describe contribution guidelines.
- Add safe unit tests or examples in a controlled environment (for example, launching a test process locally and demonstrating harmless interactions).

## Contributing

Contributions via issues and pull requests are welcome. Avoid submitting examples or documentation that facilitates malicious use in public PRs. Follow the repository's security and ethical guidelines before contributing.
